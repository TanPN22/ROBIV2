Docklight V2.0.5
Copyright 2013 Flachmann und Heggelbacher GbR (www.fuh-edv.de)

Program Description:
Docklight is a test, analysis and simulation tool for serial communication 
protocols (RS232, RS485/422 and others). It allows you to monitor the 
communication between two serial devices or to test the serial communication
of a single device. Docklight is easy to use and runs on almost any standard 
PC using Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista or Windows XP operating system.

Installation:
- Run the "setup.exe" application. 

Distribution:
- See the "fuh_distribute_int.txt" file

Docklight / Docklight Scripting V2.0.5 (02/2013)
New features and functions: 
- New script command "DL.SetHandshakeSignals rts As Boolean, dtr As Boolean", e.g.
  DL.SetHandshakeSignals true, false
Fixes and Improvements: 
- Improved COM port enumeration for the Project Settings dialog. Fixed freeze / very
  slow enumeration on some recent systems, additional port descriptions.
- Fixed issue with program shutdown behavior (e.g. on program close through 
  Task Manager or setup.exe). 
- In "Flow Control = Manual" you can change RTS/DTR states now without opening the 
  COM port. A "Flow Control = Manual" project now always start with RTS=low and 
  DTR = low
- DL.SetChannelSettings now allow changing baud rates and other serial parameters 
  on-the-fly, i.e. without closing the communication channel first. 
- Fixed v2.0.1 bug: Communication Filter not correctly maintained after a project
  was loaded via DL.OpenProject

  Baud Rate "None" = Don't set serial communication settings (baud rate, parity ...) 
  (to avoid problems with virtual COM drivers / Embedded COM stacks that do not support this)

New features and functions: 
- Support for Docklight Monitoring Tap USB - Choose comm.channels TAP0 / TAP1
  (e.g.) instead of COM4 / COM5 for best monitoring accuracy better than 10 
  milliseconds

  use a third party program editor with advanced editing features like 
  syntax highlighting
- Break Script menu/toolbar and DL.Break method: 
  interrupts script execution and shows the current line in the editor
- #include statement / include file support for scripts
 
Fixes and Improvements:
- Keyboard console state is now remembered when communication is stopped and 
  started again.
- Flow Control Support "Manual" now displays the RI (Ring Indicator) status, too
- Multiple input / output files: 
  Up to 4 FileInput objects and 4 FileOutput objects can be used simultaneously

Docklight / Docklight Scripting V1.7.37 (06/2007)
Fixes and Improvements:
- For ASCII log files, the ASCII character code 26 is now replaced by 127.
  ASCII code 26 serves as a end-of-file mark for text files and should be 
  avoided in text files.
- Improved behavior when CR only or LF only is used for end-of-line: 
  The line break is now inserted always before a comm.direction change, a new 
  date/time stamp or a comment.
- Improved behavior when a TCP client is immediately rejected: 2 seconds idle
  time before retry.

- The "Edit Send/Receive Sequence" dialogs show the current cursor position 
  and support cursor keys (Page Up/Down, Cursor Up/Down, Home/End).
- Minimum time for "Send Sequence periodically" now 0.01 sec (before: 0.1 sec)
- Additional operations on sequence lists: Import from a project file, 
  swap receive and send sequence lists.

  settings within one Send Sequence. 
- Receive Sequence supports "&" Delay function character to detect pauses.

Docklight V1.6.23 / Docklight Scripting V1.6.23 (01/2007)
Fixes and Improvements:
- HTML help instead of Winhelp to prepare Docklight for Windows Vista
- Window size correctly remembered after closing Docklight, even when maximized.
- Font sizes < 10 now allowed (with additional warning) 
- Control characters except CR/LF can be completely suppressed in ASCII display
10:16 02.04.2007- Baud rates up to 9.999.999 Baud can be entered (NOTE: This does not mean
  Docklight can really process any kind of data at that speed.) 
- Fixed bug: A "CR only" produces an additional line break in HEX, Decimal and 
  Binary display
- Fixed bug: The keyboard console tool always sets the RTS line to high when 
  typing characters
- Fixed bug: The DCD line status is not displayed

  BREAK state introduces additional spaces in HEX, Decimal and Binary display

Docklight V1.6.8 / Docklight Scripting V1.6.8 (04/2005)
Fixes and Improvements:
- Flow control setting "RS485 Transceiver Control" is now correctly applied for
  the Keyboard Console tool.

  Receive Sequences (set/reset handshake signals, add delay between characters, 
  send or detect a "break" state)
Fixes and Improvements:
- Keyboard Shortcuts for ASCII code > 126
- DEL key for Send/Receive Sequence lists
- Docklight Scripting: Increased maximum script size (510KB instead of 64KB)
- Inreased Docklight send/receive queue size to allow character-by-character 
  processing using DL_OnReceive()
- Extended documentation and sample scripts to demonstrate Docklight Scripting's 
  data analysis and manipulation capabilities.
- Fixed bug: Docklight crashes when a USB-to-RS232 device is removed while 
  communication is running. 
- Fixed problem: When using Option "Flow Control: RS485 transceiver control",
  the RTS line is reset too early, especially when the standard 16 byte fifo 
  transmit buffer of the UART is enabled.
- Fixed bug: Missing characters in ASCII window / Formatted Text Output mode,
  when characters are received one-by-one and a single <CR> is used for end-of-line

New features and functions:
- Extended syntax for the DL.SendSequence command to allow hex, decimal or binary
  Send Sequence parameters or sending custom data sequences.
- DL_OnSend() function to support automatic checksum calculations
- DL_OnReceive() function to support automatic evaluation of the received data,
  including analysing the received wildcard data
Fixes:

Docklight V1.4.14 / Docklight Scripting V1.4.14  (06/2004)
Fixes:
- Fixed bug: Missing line breaks on Windows 98
- Fixed bug: "Clear Communication Window" does not delete the entire contents of
  all four commmunications window representations (ASCII/HEX/Decimal/Binary)

Docklight V1.4.12 / Docklight Scripting V1.4.12  (05/2004)
New features and functions:
- New Docklight edition "Scripting" with built-in script editor for automated testing.
  Available as an upgrade for Docklight standard users. 
Fixes & Improvements:
- Non-standard baud rates can be used: Type any integer number between 110 and 999999
  in the corresponding dialog box. If the chosen rate is actually applied, depends on 
  the serial UART you are using. Non-standard baud rates may not work correctly when 
  "Flow Control" options are used.
- New Mode "Flow Control: Hardware Handshaking - RTS/CTS (Single Byte Mode):
  A sequence is placed byte-by-byte into the transmit buffer and CTS is checked before 
  each new character.
- New mode "Flow Control: RTS high while sending". This is to support RS485
  converters and related applications where the transceiver requires the PCs RTS signal
  to enable/disable the transmission.
- Improved communication processing and timing accuracy, which makes the "TweakComm" 
  utility provided to some users obsolete.
- ASCII Communication Window: Uniform behavior for different end-of-line standards:
  CR only, CR+LF, LF+CR

V1.3.38 (01/2004)
Fixes:
- Fixed bug: receive sequence detection ignores incoming sequence, 
  if immediately before the sequence a few characters have already been 
  considered as a part of this sequence.   
  See http://www.docklight.de/troubleshooting_en.htm for details.
- Fixed bug: edit sequence dialog crashes when marking a sequence, then 
  moving to the empty sequence at the end of the list (Index ">" button) and
  pasting into the empty sequence.
- Fixed bug: crash when trying to paste a very large document (> 32K) from clipboard.

V1.3 (11/2003)
New features and functions:
- Powerful clipboard support within the sequence lists and the sequence 
  editor: cut, copy & paste entire sequences or parts of it. Copy & paste 
  sequence data from external applications (MS Word, Notepad).
- Wildcard support for send sequences, receive sequences and find function
- New receive sequence actions: insert time stamp, stop communication
- New time stamp options: pause detection, e.g. for RS485 monitoring.
- Keyboard console: keyboard input is directly sent to the COM port.
- New Project settings: optional flow control support, 
  manual RTS/DTR control, hardware handshaking, 
  software handshaking (XON/XOFF).
Fixes & Improvements:
- Fixed bug when printing on HP Laserjet 5M
- Improved sequence list management (reordering, keyboard support)
